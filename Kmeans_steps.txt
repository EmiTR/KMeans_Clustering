General steps to be done when applying Kmeans clustering technique:
- Data Preparation
    Collect relevant variables.
    Clean missing values, duplicates, outliers (since K-Means is sensitive to them).
    ...
- Feature Engineering
    K-Means uses Euclidean distance, so scale matters.
    Apply standardization (Z-score) or min–max normalization, depending on data.
- Choose the Number of Clusters (k)
    K is not known in advance — you need to test.
    Common methods:
        Elbow Method 
        Silhouette Score 
        Gap Statistic

- Run the K-Means Algorithm
    Initialize centroids (random or k-means++).
    Assign points to nearest centroid (cluster membership).
    Update centroids as mean of assigned points.
    Repeat until convergence (no big centroid changes).

- Evaluate the Results

- Interpret the Clusters
